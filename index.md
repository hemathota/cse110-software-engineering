## Technical Background and Interests
- My first introduction to Computer Science was in 11th grade. I vividly remember how terrible I was in my Object Oriented Programming with C++ class where my peers were way ahead of me. I worked hard to keep up with the course and unknowingly, started falling in love with programming :computer:  
- This pursuaded me to do my my undergrad in computer science at MS Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bangalore, India  :woman_student:
- Post my undergrad, I worked in the industry for a couple of years where I gained hands-on-skills in web development, cloud computing, data engineering, databases and data visualization. I felt getting way too comfortable at my work...  :woman_technologist:
- Hence, to challenge myself and expand my knowlege, I decided to pursue my masters :books: 
- And what a journey it has been - there is so much I have learnt not just technically but also personally as I have stepped out of the comfort zone of my family and loved ones :v: 
- I want to work as a Software Engineering solving challenging problem and writing useful code :desktop_computer:
